I am a recent graduate from the University of Southern California with an MS in Applied Data Science, and I hold a BS in Statistics & Data Science from UC Santa Barbara. My work sits at the intersection of quantitative finance, machine learning, and algorithmic trading.

## Research & Projects

My recent work focuses on developing systematic trading strategies using machine learning and alternative data:

**FinBERT Sentiment Alpha Strategy**  
Built a sentiment-based trading strategy using FinBERT on 330,000+ financial headlines (2009-2020). Implemented Information Coefficient analysis and Fama-French factor attribution, achieving 14.5% annualized alpha before transaction costs.

**Market Tempo: Jazz Patterns in Financial Markets**  
An innovative research project exploring correlations between Charlie Parker's jazz rhythms and SPY price movements using Dynamic Time Warping. Achieved 72% accuracy for 60-minute price predictions.

**FVG-OB Algorithmic Trading Strategy**  
Developed and optimized a Fair Value Gap and Order Block detection system using the Lumibot framework with Polygon data and Alpaca broker integration. Currently my best-performing systematic strategy.

**Large-Scale Recommendation Systems**  
Built collaborative filtering systems using Apache Spark and XGBoost on Yelp datasets with millions of records. Implemented BFR clustering and frequent itemset mining algorithms.

## Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, Scala
- **ML/Data:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, Apache Spark, Pandas
- **Finance:** Options trading, Technical analysis (RSI, EMA, Bollinger Bands), FinBERT

## Experience

**Market Data Analyst** — Namefi.io  
Built Web3 analytics pipelines processing terabytes of on-chain data for market intelligence.

## Currently

I am actively seeking quantitative research and trading roles at firms like SIG, Jane Street, and Optiver. I have 36 months of STEM OPT work authorization.

Feel free to reach out to discuss quantitative strategies, algorithmic trading, or opportunities in the space.
