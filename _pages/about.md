I am a recent graduate from the University of Southern California with an MS in Applied Data Science, and I hold a BS in Statistics & Data Science from UC Santa Barbara. My work sits at the intersection of quantitative finance, machine learning, and algorithmic trading.

## Research & Projects

My recent work focuses on developing systematic trading strategies using machine learning and alternative data:

**FinBERT Sentiment Alpha Strategy**  
Built sentiment signal from **330K+ financial headlines** (S&P 500, 2009–2020) using FinBERT; achieved **0.71% daily IC** and **15% annualized alpha** (t=2.73) after Fama-French risk adjustment. Optimized strategy to **Sharpe 1.26** with weekly rebalancing and news volume filters. [GitHub →](https://github.com/MeilinP/FinBERT_Sentiment_Analysis_on_SP500Constitutes)
**Market Tempo: Jazz Patterns in Financial Markets**  
An innovative research project exploring correlations between Charlie Parker's jazz rhythms and SPY price movements using Dynamic Time Warping. Achieved 72% accuracy for 60-minute price predictions.

**FVG-OB Algorithmic Trading Strategy**  
Developed and optimized a Fair Value Gap and Order Block detection system using the Lumibot framework with Polygon data and Alpaca broker integration. Currently my best-performing systematic strategy.

**Large-Scale Recommendation Systems**  
Built collaborative filtering systems using Apache Spark and XGBoost on Yelp datasets with millions of records. Implemented BFR clustering and frequent itemset mining algorithms.
